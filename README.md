OpenClassrooms Project 6. (JavaScript, OOP, DOM, JQuery)
Tasks: Create an online game written JavaScript in which 2 players play each turn to compete.

1. Randomly geerate game map, which consists of empty and dimmed squares.
2. Invent 4 types of weapons, each with different damage inflicted, place them randomly on the map.
   One of weapons is default for players.
3. Create players, that are randomly placed on the map upon game start

4. For each turn, a player can move from one to three boxes (horizontally or vertically) before ending their turn.
   They can't pass through obstacles directly
5. If a player passes over a box containing a weapon, they leave their current weapon on site and replace it with the new one.

6. Fightmode: when players are close to each other, fight begins. Each player has one move in turn and can either attack the opponent, or defend themselves.
   Attack will lessen opponent's health according to active player's weapon damage. Defence will halve opponents attack damage in next turn.
7. When player's lifepoints reach 0, game is over and the message appears.
